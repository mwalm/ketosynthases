# Exploring ketosynthase substrate specificity with machine learning

Welcome to the repository for my second PhD thesis chapter, which explores the proofreading phenomenon of ketosynthases. 

In this repository, you will find a copy of chapter two (.pdf), which has been written as a standalone text for purposes of understanding this body of work in isolation. In this document, you will find an introduction to modular polyketide synthases, machine learning and structural biology, as well as the results and discussion produced from this body of work. This document was written with both biologists and computer scientists in mind – I have contained primers for both disciplines within the document and its footnotes. The document tracks my experience applying different methodologies of machine learning to structural data; if you are here because you are only interested in ketosynthases and acyltransferases, skip to the section on graph neural networks. 

You will also find Jupyter notebooks (Python scripts), R scripts and datasets of AlphaFold structures produced in this body of work in this repository. These have been named using a directory structure that is used in the .pdf for chapter two. If you plan on running any of this code yourself, please note the package versions and operating system requirements listed in the .pdf – some of the packages were particularly fragile to install (notably R-Keras and Graphein). 

A note on copy write: 
At the time of writing, none of the work contained here has been published (I am currently doing some experimental validation of the machine learning results, to tie into a combined paper). Please do not copy, reproduce or distribute files contained here.
