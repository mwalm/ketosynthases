# Exploring ketosynthase substrate specificity with machine learning

Welcome to the repository for "Graph Neural Networks predict ketosynthase substrate specificity" [link to paper once published], which explores the proofreading phenomenon of ketosynthases using machine learning. 

In this repository, you will find all code and data associated with the paper. 

Also included here is a copy of chapter two (.pdf) from my doctoral thesis, which has been written as a standalone text for purposes of understanding this body of work in isolation. In this document, you will find an introduction to modular polyketide synthases, machine learning and structural biology, as well as the results and discussion produced from this body of work. This document was written with both biologists and computer scientists in mind â€“ I have contained primers for both disciplines within the document and its footnotes. The document tracks my experience applying different methodologies of machine learning to structural data (some of which did not go into the paper); if you are here because you are only interested in ketosynthases and acyltransferases, skip to the section on graph neural networks. You will also find Jupyter notebooks (Python scripts), R scripts and datasets of AlphaFold structures produced in this body of work in this repository. These have been named using a directory structure that is used in the .pdf for chapter two.
